## How to use
The app is very easy to use. Start by creating a 'Wish List' of burgers you'd like to eat. With every burger you eat just click the 'Eat It' button to move them over to the 'Devoured Lis'.

## Languages and Lessons
The exercises in this project focussed on learning SQL/MySQL, Express, Heroku Deployment, and Handlebars. Organization of files and separation of concerns with the MVC paradigm was also a large part of the project. 

## How to contribute
If anyone would like to improve the app by contributing, they're welcome to submit a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/keiththarp/plant-based-burger-bonanza).
